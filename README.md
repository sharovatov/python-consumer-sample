# Python consumer sample

A small CLI that asks the bundled `producer` executable to add two integers
from 0 through 9 and forwards its output unchanged. Repeated calls can return
different wording for the same sum.

Requires Python 3.7 or newer and a compatible `producer` executable beside
`consumer.py`. The supplied binary is built for macOS on Apple Silicon.
There are no Python package dependencies or installation steps.

```sh
./consumer sum 2 3
./consumer sum 4 5
./consumer sum 9 9
```

The Python entry point can also be called directly:

```sh
python3 consumer.py sum 2 3
```

The consumer passes the two arguments to `producer`, inherits its stdout and
stderr, and returns its exit status (128 + signal number if terminated by a
signal). It does not parse, rephrase, or correct the response.

The producer rejects invalid operands with a diagnostic on stderr and exit
status 2. If the executable cannot be started, the consumer reports the error
on stderr and exits with status 1.
